# Summary

ImagingReso is an open-source Python library that simulates the neutron 
resonance signal for neutron imaging measurements. By defining the sample 
information such as density, thickness in the neutron path, and isotopic 
ratios of the elemental composition of the material, this package plots 
the expected resonance peaks for a selected neutron energy range. Various 
sample types such as layers of single elements (Ag, Co, etc. in solid form), 
chemical compounds (UO<sub>3</sub>, Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, etc.), 
or even multiple layers of both types can be plotted with this package. 
Major plotting features include display of the transmission/attenuation 
in wavelength, energy, and time scale, and show/hide elemental and isotopic 
contributions in the total resonance signal.

The energy dependent cross-section data used in this library are from 
[National Nuclear Data Center](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/), an online database 
published by Brookhaven National Laboratory. 
[Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF/B)](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/exfor/endf00.jsp) 
is currently supported and more evaluated databases will be added in the future.
